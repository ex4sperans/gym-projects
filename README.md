# gym-projects
A repo for my solutions to OpenAI's Gym problems. 

I'm using Tensorflow as the main framework for building graphs, so you have to install it to be capable of running the experiments. 

At the moment, solutions to the following problems are provided: 

1. Cartpole. 

To run the experiment, execute:
```
python3 cartpole.py
```
